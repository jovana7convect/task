Let's start with package.json file

Here’s a brief overview of the packages used in this project:

@angular/animations: Provides tools for building complex animations in Angular, enhancing the visual experience of the application.
@angular/cdk: A set of Angular components and services that provide common building blocks for Angular Material and other UI libraries.
@angular/common: Contains common Angular utilities and services, such as pipes, directives, and other essential building blocks.
@angular/compiler: Responsible for compiling Angular templates and component classes at runtime and during development.
@angular/core: The foundational package for building Angular applications, providing services, directives, and other core components.
@angular/forms: Enables the creation of forms in Angular, including template-driven and reactive forms, and managing their validation.
@angular/material: A UI component library that implements Google’s Material Design for Angular applications.
@angular/router: Facilitates navigation and routing in Angular applications, allowing developers to define routes and handle navigation logic.
@ngrx/store: A state management library inspired by Redux, designed to help manage state in Angular applications in a predictable manner.
rxjs: A reactive programming library that facilitates the use of observables for handling asynchronous data streams.
@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin: Provides TypeScript-specific linting rules for ESLint to enforce best practices in TypeScript codebases.
eslint: A tool that analyzes JavaScript and TypeScript code to identify and fix issues, ensuring code quality and consistency.
eslint-config-prettier: Disables conflicting rules between ESLint and Prettier, allowing for seamless integration of both tools.
eslint-plugin-import: Enforces consistent import statement rules, helping developers follow best practices for module imports.
eslint-plugin-jsdoc: Adds JSDoc-specific linting rules to ensure proper documentation in the codebase using JSDoc syntax.
eslint-plugin-prettier: Integrates Prettier with ESLint, allowing Prettier formatting to be enforced as part of the linting process.
husky: A tool that manages Git hooks, enabling you to run scripts such as linting or testing before committing or pushing changes.
lint-staged: Runs linters on staged files in Git, ensuring only the files that have been changed are linted before committing.
ng-packagr: A tool used for packaging Angular libraries, helping developers bundle and distribute Angular code as npm packages.
prettier: A code formatter that ensures consistent formatting by automatically fixing issues like indentation, spacing, and line breaks.
ts-node: A TypeScript execution engine for Node.js that allows TypeScript code to run directly without needing to compile it first.
typescript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other advanced features to help develop robust applications.
